# IS-5540-Final-Project

This project will take a look at a csv file on spam emails and use the data to create 
models that predict whether an email is spam or not. The rmd file can be downloaded
and run to output a word document containing a report on the project. The raw code for 
this file is also avaible in this repository if desired. A word document will also be attached to 
this repository that contains the same report but reformatted to have better spacing 
between the pages due to the graphs. This project also requires the packages tidyverse, 
ggthemes, and rpart to run successfully. The csv file should not be required to be 
downloaded for the rmd file to run properly but is attached in case there are any errors
or troubles. When looking at the visuals in this project, some variables were excluded 
due to formatting reasons.
