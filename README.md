# IS-5540-Final-Project

This project will take a look at a csv file on spam emails and use the data to create 
models that predict whether an email is spam or not. The rmd file can be downloaded
and run to output a word document containing a report on the project. A word document 
will also be attached to this repository that contains the same report but reformatted 
to have better spacing between the pages due to the graphs. This project also requires 
the packages tidyverse, ggthemes, and rpart to run successfully.
